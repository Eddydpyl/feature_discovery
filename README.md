# Feature Discovery ![Status: abandoned](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-abandoned-red.svg)

Implementation of the material design pattern for [feature discovery](https://material.io/archive/guidelines/growth-communications/feature-discovery.html) by [Matthew Carroll](https://github.com/matthew-carroll).
Import into your project by adding the following dependency:
```yaml
feature_discovery:
  git:
    url: git://github.com/darter/feature_discovery.git
```
The FeatureDiscovery widget has been added to the [flutter_widgets](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_widgets#017) library. Use that instead.
